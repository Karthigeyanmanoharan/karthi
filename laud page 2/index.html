            <div class="grandchild2"><p>Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, Bengali pronunciation: [kad͡ʒi nod͡ʒrul islam] (audio speaker iconlisten); 24 May 1899 – 29 August 1976) was a Bangladeshi poet, writer, musician, and the national poet of the country.[4] Nazrul is regarded as one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature. Popularly known as Nazrul, he produced a large body of poetry, music, messages, novels, stories, etc. with themes that included equality, justice, anti-imperialism, humanity, rebellion against oppression and religious devotion.</p></div>

                <div class="grandchild4"><P>Nazrul wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records),[22] collectively known as Nazrul Geeti. In 1942 at the age of 43, he began to suffer from an unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. A medical team in Vienna diagnosed the disease as Pick's disease,[23] a rare incurable neurodegenerative disease. It caused Nazrul's health to decline steadily and forced him to live in isolation.</P></div>
